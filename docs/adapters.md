# Runtime Adapters — running the Coach anywhere

The repo is the deployment unit. The Python core (`skills/`, `coach_tools.py`,
DuckDB) is runtime-agnostic; every agent runtime attaches through MCP (the
primary surface) or the CLI. The persona lives in **`docs/COACH_PROMPT.md`**
(canonical) — point your harness's agent at it. The former opencode native
adapter (`.opencode/`, `opencode.json`) was removed; opencode-class runtimes
attach like everything else, via MCP.

## One-time setup (all runtimes)

```bash
uv venv .venv && uv pip install -r requirements.txt
alembic upgrade head        # bootstrap data/gym_coach.duckdb
```

## MCP-capable runtimes (Claude Code, ZCode, Cursor, Codex CLI, Continue, …)

`mcp_server.py` exposes all 16 coach tools + `coach_doctrine` (procedural
disclosure over MCP) over stdio. All runtimes share this one server. Each tool
call opens the DuckDB file and releases it on return, so an idle server never
blocks `alembic`, the CLI or a second runtime.

**Claude Code** — repo-root `.mcp.json` is picked up automatically (or
`claude mcp add gym-coach -- .venv/bin/python mcp_server.py`). On Windows
the committed POSIX path does not exist: register a local-scope override,
`claude mcp add gym-coach --scope local -- .venv\Scripts\python.exe mcp_server.py`. For the
persona, create a subagent (`.claude/agents/coach.md`) whose body is
`docs/COACH_PROMPT.md` — or register it in `scripts/sync_adapters.py`'s
`ADAPTERS` list and run the script to render it automatically.

**ZCode** — **wired.** The workspace config `.zcode/config.json` registers
the `gym-coach` MCP server (absolute paths to `.venv/bin/python` +
`mcp_server.py`); ZCode auto-connects workspace-scoped servers at session
start. The workspace skill `.zcode/skills/gym-coach/SKILL.md` routes
coaching requests ("coach me", "log today: …") to the persona: it directs
the agent to read `docs/COACH_PROMPT.md` and use the `coach_*` MCP tools.
The vendored skills under `docs/knowledge/*/SKILL.md` are also directly
loadable as SKILL.md-format skills.

**Cursor / Codex CLI / Continue / others** — any stdio MCP server entry with
command `<repo>/.venv/bin/python`, args `["mcp_server.py"]`, cwd `<repo>`
works. Use `coach_doctrine` with `topic="index"` when the runtime cannot read
the repo's knowledge files directly.

## Any bash-capable agent, no MCP

It can drive everything through `python coach_tools.py <cmd> '<json>'`
(JSON to stdout; `{"error": ...}` + exit 1 on failure) once it reads
`docs/COACH_PROMPT.md` for the workflow. You lose only the typed tool
schemas. Note the CLI payload ceiling: the whole payload is one argv
argument, so the OS rejects anything past ~128 KB on Linux (`E2BIG` at
spawn, before the tool runs) — long free text belongs on the MCP surface.

## Adding a native agent-file adapter

If a runtime needs its own agent file rather than MCP config: add a
`(frontmatter, target_path)` entry to `ADAPTERS` in
`scripts/sync_adapters.py`, then run `python scripts/sync_adapters.py`
(`--check` verifies drift after you edit COACH_PROMPT.md). Both wrappers
(CLI and MCP) dispatch through the same handlers in `coach_tools.py` —
change handlers there, never the wrappers.
