"""MCP server — exposes the coach tools over stdio for ANY MCP-capable runtime.

Claude Code, ZCode, Cursor, Codex CLI, Continue, etc. attach this
one server instead of per-runtime tool glue. It wraps the SAME handlers as
the CLI dispatcher (coach_tools.py) — change handlers there, never here.
Signature defaults are imported from coach_tools so they cannot drift.

Plus `coach_doctrine(topic)`: procedural disclosure over MCP — returns the
routing table, or a knowledge file's content, for runtimes that cannot read
the repo's files directly.

Run:    python mcp_server.py          (stdio transport)
Config: see docs/adapters.md and .mcp.json
