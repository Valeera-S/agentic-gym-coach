"""Tier 1 working-memory state — injected into the orchestrator at session start.

MEMORY_PROTOCOL §1: this is RAM, refreshed each session. Holds exactly what
the LLM needs to reason about TODAY: recovery, active injuries, current
phase, and recent specialization context. ~3K-token hard cap (enforced by
the orchestrator via `estimate_tokens()`).
