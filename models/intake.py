"""Intake-assessment models — the standardized "bucket list" of everything
the coach needs before programming decisions, and the report of what the
database already holds.

The checklist is DATA (INTAKE_CHECKLIST), not prompt prose: one entry per
intake factor, each citing its vendored-book source or carrying an explicit
HEURISTIC label (unsourced doctrine was deliberately removed from this repo —
a heuristic field must say so, see docs/IDEAS.md #1). skills.intake.assess_
intake() scans stored state against this list; the coach cites what's
present (asking "still accurate?"), asks only for what's missing, in
checklist order, and applies the soft per-domain gates (COACH_PROMPT
"Standardized intake assessment").

Excluded from the bucket list on purpose (docs/adr/0001-...md and
docs/adr/0002-omitted-and-derived-intake-fields.md): sleep as a static field
(both books treat recovery questions as recurring check-ins), food
allergies/dislikes (the nutrition book is anti-preference-exclusion),
budget/cooking skill, clinical screening, motivation scoring — and, after
first-use feedback: meals (frequency is book-neutral, Nutrition ch05),
social support (too abstract, effect unpredictable), priority muscles
(derived from goals + observed weak points, never asked). They stay
answerable as ordinary coaching questions.
