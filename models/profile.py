"""User profile + memory-note models — the v2 "who am I coaching" state.

The profile is validated data, not prompt text: goals, training age, schedule,
equipment, and muscle priorities drive orchestrator/snapshot behavior
directly. `physique_target` names the aesthetic outcome (ripped / athletic /
bulky); achieving it spans BOTH vendored skills — training (helms-training-
pyramid) and nutrition (helms-nutrition-pyramid) — and the coach routes
accordingly.
