"""Exercise catalog — alias → (canonical_name, muscle_group, secondaries).

The canonicalization layer: ingestion looks up every raw name here and writes
the canonical name + muscle_group into DuckDB so trend_analysis groups
cleanly without the user ever categorizing anything themselves.

Secondaries implement Helms' overlap doctrine (Muscle & Strength Pyramid:
Training ch03): primary AND secondary muscle contributions count 1:1 toward
a muscle's weekly hard sets. trend_analysis credits them via
SECONDARY_OVERLAP.

Extensibility: unknown exercises fall back to keyword matching, are mapped
best-effort, and flagged for review (returned via `canonicalize(...).needs_review`)
so the user can confirm the mapping — ingestion never blocks on an unknown.
