# AGENTS.md — Agentic Gym Coach (v2)

Workspace state: **v2.3 — standardized intake (2026-09-19).** Onboarding is replaced by a code-driven intake assessment: the bucket list is data (`models/intake.py::INTAKE_CHECKLIST`, every field book-cited or labeled HEURISTIC), `skills/intake.py::assess_intake()` scans stored state for collected vs missing, surfaced as `coach_intake_status` (CLI + MCP). Gates are soft per-domain (`training_ready`/`nutrition_ready`): no volunteered plans when not ready, provisional plans that name their gaps only on explicit user insistence. One flow, no modes — see `docs/adr/0001-standardized-intake-soft-gates.md` and `CONTEXT.md` (glossary). Ticket-02's staleness signal shipped inside it: `session_gap` on the snapshot + `weeks_since_last_session` on Tier-1, threshold `REASSESSMENT_GAP_WEEKS` in `skills/snapshot.py` (a labeled heuristic, not book-sourced). Earlier: v2.2 night-run maintenance pass (2026-09-17) — CLI + MCP only; dual Helms skills vendored as the only doctrine; injuries write path validates + canonicalizes via `skills/injuries.py` (single owner of the injury_status schema), one phase resolver (`skills/phase.py`), one Epley definition (`skills/metrics.py`), enforced Tier-1 3K-token cap, three-code error contract (`invalid_input` / `db` / `internal`), surface defaults single-sourced with a CI drift test (tests/test_surface_drift.py). CLI cold start ~0.16s (lancedb import is lazy). 204 tests + 1 slow perf guard passing.

## Read order & precedence
Read before writing any code or answering architecture questions:
1. **SPEC.md** — v2 schema, skill inventory, surfaces, invariants
2. **CONTEXT.md** — the glossary; use these terms exactly (intake assessment, gate, provisional plan, …)
3. **MEMORY_PROTOCOL.md** — three-tier memory, state transitions, safety guards
4. **`docs/COACH_PROMPT.md`** — the canonical Coach persona (rendered into runtime agent files)
5. **`docs/adapters.md`** — how runtimes attach (MCP is the single tool surface)
6. **`docs/IDEAS.md`** — future feature ideas / dev notebook; consult before proposing features, record new ones there

Conflict resolution: **safety layer > vendored skills (`docs/knowledge/helms-*`) > mechanics docs.** v1 knowledge documents were removed as unsourced — never resurrect their doctrine; extend knowledge by vendoring a book-skill, not by hand-writing physiology.

## Tech stack (pinned in requirements.txt)
duckdb · polars · lancedb · pydantic · alembic · duckdb-engine · pytest · plotly · pytz (DuckDB TIMESTAMPTZ conversion) · mcp (stdio server) · Python 3.11+

- OLAP: `data/gym_coach.duckdb` (persistent file mode)
- Vectors: `data/lance_db/` (deferred — Tier 3 uses DuckDB tables in v2)
- Migrations: `migrations/` (Alembic — never hand-edit schema)

## Source of truth
**The DuckDB file is canonical.** New sessions enter via the Coach (`coach_log_session`) or `python scripts/ingest_log.py <file>` for one-shot bulk imports. The user writes only raw logs ("Squat 3x5 @ RPE 8"); everything else is derived.

## Commands
Interpreter: use `.venv/bin/python` (repo venv) — bare `python` is not on PATH and the system Python has none of the deps installed.

```bash
.venv/bin/python -m pytest -q            # full suite (~3s); pytest.ini addopts already skip -m slow
.venv/bin/python -m pytest -m slow -q    # 10K-row perf guard (run separately)
.venv/bin/python scripts/ingest_log.py --dry-run [file]   # parse a log.md, no DB writes
.venv/bin/python scripts/ingest_log.py --reset [file]     # ⚠ DELETE FROM sessions first, then re-ingest
.venv/bin/python coach_tools.py          # dispatcher — prints available subcommands (13)
alembic upgrade head                    # apply migrations (bootstrap a fresh DB this way)
.venv/bin/python scripts/sync_adapters.py    # render COACH_PROMPT.md → native agent files, if any registered (--check for drift)
.venv/bin/python mcp_server.py          # MCP stdio server (13 tools + coach_doctrine)
```

No lint/typecheck config exists in this repo — don't invoke tools that aren't set up.

## Modularity & maintainability
- **Skills are standalone, deterministic Python modules** in `skills/`. Each returns Pydantic models (not dicts). No LLM logic lives here — reasoning happens in the orchestrator/agent.
- Adding/changing a skill → add a module + `tests/test_skills/test_<name>.py`.
- `models/` holds all Pydantic schemas. `models/enums.py` is the controlled vocabulary for DB-stored vocabularies (profile-local enums live beside their models in `models/profile.py`) — DB columns store VARCHAR (including the per-exercise `muscle_group` inside the `sessions.exercises` struct, since migration 0003), Pydantic enforces (extending a vocabulary needs no migration).
- **Adding a coach tool touches three places:** a handler in `coach_tools.py` (DISPATCH), an MCP wrapper in `mcp_server.py`, and a line in `docs/COACH_PROMPT.md`.
- Schema changes go through Alembic migrations only — never hand-edit `data/gym_coach.duckdb`.

## Dev gotchas
- **Tests never touch production data.** `conftest.py` points `GYM_COACH_DUCKDB`/`GYM_COACH_LANCE` at throwaway files in `/tmp` and wipes tables around every test. Those env vars redirect the DB anywhere — but paths are read at `skills.init` import time, so set them before the first import.
- **Single-process pytest only** — pytest-xdist workers collide on the shared temp DB file.
- **Coach tool layering:** `mcp_server.py` and the shell both wrap the same handlers in `coach_tools.py` (JSON to stdout; `{"error": ...}` + exit 1 on failure) → skill in `skills/`. Change handlers, never the wrappers.
- **Edit the persona in `docs/COACH_PROMPT.md` only.** Runtimes read it directly; if a native agent-file adapter is registered in `scripts/sync_adapters.py`, re-run it after editing.
- **The Coach agent must not edit code** — `docs/COACH_PROMPT.md` restricts it to `coach_*` tools + read/grep/glob. Code changes are the coding agent's job.
- **pytz is required at runtime** for DuckDB TIMESTAMPTZ → Python conversion (memory/profile RETURNING paths).

## Repo-specific constraints (differ from defaults)
- **Polars, never Pandas** — strict.
- **Pydantic V2** validates all inputs/outputs at DuckDB boundaries; per-set arrays (reps/rpe/weight_kg) must be equal length (enforced by validator).
- **`coach_snapshot` computes AND upserts** today's `phase_snapshots` row on every call (decision 2026-09-17, resolving audit Q3/T10: idempotent upsert by snapshot_date; MEMORY_PROTOCOL §2.3 states the same policy).
- **Volume currency = effective hard sets** (form_quality < 3 ⇒ 50% discount; primary + secondary 1:1 via `SECONDARY_OVERLAP`; bodyweight sets count). Tonnage is detail-only. est_1RM from reps ≤ 6 sets only.
- **`safety_gate.check_exercise_safety()` is deterministic** — if it returns unsafe, never suggest that exercise; offer `SafetyResult` alternatives instead.
- **No LLM reasoning inside `skills/`** — skills are pure code.
- **Tier 3 memory writes require explicit user command** ("save this"). Never auto-write. Profiles may be written after user confirmation (echo + confirm).
- **Cite retrieved values explicitly** — never paraphrase from memory. If retrieval returns null, say "I don't have that data." Do not guess.
- **Log every plan modification** (incl. goal changes — automatic in `skills/profile.py`) to the decision audit trail.
- **Doctrine questions route through the vendored skills** (`docs/knowledge/helms-*/SKILL.md`) — at most one knowledge file per turn.

## Error posture
- Halt on failure. Report exact failure point + affected data + recovery options. Log to audit trail as `system_error`.
- Never silently retry, interpolate, or fabricate physiological data. Missing = "I don't have that data."

## Validation checklist (before marking any feature complete)
- [ ] DuckDB queries <100ms on 10K-row synthetic set
- [ ] `check_exercise_safety()` blocks contraindicated exercises deterministically
- [ ] Pydantic rejects malformed session logs before DB write
- [ ] Unit tests cover edge cases: empty arrays, null RPE, pain during exercise, empty profile
- [ ] Phase snapshot generates without manual intervention
- [ ] Full offline operation (no cloud except optional vision API for `visual_delta`)
