"""recovery — daily recovery score from logged signals.

The user logs minimal data (sessions/body weight/calories); sleep/HRV are not
logged. This skill derives recovery from what IS available: recent training
load (hard sets), pain events, and back-to-back training days. It is null-safe
for the missing sleep/HRV inputs (they simply don't contribute).

ponytail: the coefficients below are tunable knobs, not calibrated constants.
The composite is a transparent heuristic — fatigue = recent sets, pain is a
big negative, consecutive days add fatigue, rest days give a small bonus.
Re-tune against real outcomes once enough history exists.

Pre-session semantics: every component reads days strictly BEFORE the query
date — a session already logged on that date is excluded (counting it would
make the score circular). The output says so (`excludes_query_date: true`).

Contract: <30ms. Score 0-100. <60 ⇒ orchestrator flags autoregulation required.
