"""snapshot — compress last 4 weeks into a phase anchor document.

Builds a PhaseSnapshot from recent sessions + injury_status + user profile
and persists a phase_snapshots row (upsert by snapshot_date). Specialty 1RMs
come from Epley over qualifying sets only (reps <= 6 — "~5RM or heavier",
Training ch04). Volume is effective hard sets, overlap-inclusive, via
trend_analysis.hard_sets_by_muscle (single shared definition).

`block_state` is COMPUTED, NOT PERSISTED: weeks/blocks since the last
deload-phase TRAINING session (habit sessions excluded) — input to the
mandatory-deload floor ("deload by the
3rd mesocycle regardless", Training ch04). `session_gap` is likewise
computed, not persisted: weeks since the last logged training session (habit sessions excluded) + whether the
staleness threshold is crossed (a labeled heuristic — see
REASSESSMENT_GAP_WEEKS below). body_weight_kg / waist_cm are
None until a daily logging path exists — honest "I don't have that data".

Insight targets come from the user profile's priority muscles; no profile ⇒
the snapshot says so instead of inventing targets.

This skill PROPOSES (never auto-writes) Tier 3 semantic-memory updates; it
only persists the phase_snapshots row.

Contract: <200ms. Aggregated metrics must match recomputed values within 5%.
