"""injuries — the single owner of the injury_status table (safety source of truth).

Every read and write of injury_status goes through here; no other module
knows the table's schema (previously spread across five modules). Writes are
validated and canonicalized:

- location/status/severity are constructed as models.InjuryStatus, so an
  out-of-vocabulary value or out-of-range severity fails at write time with
  a standard validation error — instead of being stored and crashing a later
  Tier-1 load far from the faulty write (adversarial F2/F9).
- every contraindicated/alternative exercise name is canonicalized via the
  exercise catalog, so a ban written as the user said it is stored under the
  same name the safety gate queries. Names the catalog can't map are stored
  verbatim but returned in `needs_review` — the coach must confirm them with
  the user before trusting the gate on them (the known fail-open residual,
  adversarial F1 / audit Q4).
