"""phase — the single resolver of "what phase are we in".

One definition, previously copy-pasted in three places with diverging
fallbacks (orchestrator / snapshot / session_logger):

    current_phase(): latest phase_snapshots row → modal phase across logged
    TRAINING sessions (habit sessions excluded) → None (no data at all).

    phase_for_logging(): the phase to TAG a new session with — explicit user
    input wins, then current_phase(), then `maintenance` (the goal-agnostic
    off-season default, Training ch04). The fallback keeps the user from
    ever having to tag a phase by hand.
